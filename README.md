## Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:
1. Design Patterns are already defined and provides **industry standard approach** to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many java design patterns that we can use in our java based projects.
2. Using design patterns promotes **reusability** that leads to more **robust** and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
3. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new members of team understand it easily.

# Structured
Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories â€“ **creational**, **structural** and **ehavioral** design patterns. This post serves as an index for all the java design patterns articles I have written so far.

* Creational Design Patterns
  * Singleton Pattern
  * Factory Pattern
  * Abstract Factory Pattern
  * Builder Pattern
  * Prototype Pattern
* Structural Design Patterns
  * Adapter Pattern
  * Composite Pattern
  * Proxy Pattern
  * Flyweight Pattern
  * Facade Pattern
  * Bridge Pattern
